# Building the engine
## Prerequisites
- [Haxe 4.3.6](https://haxe.org/download/)
- [Windows SDK (If you are on Windows. I think)](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/)

## Building
- Download the engine source
- Go in `project` and run `setup.bat`, it should download all necessary libraries
- Open a cmd/terminal in the engine root, and build the engine as normal `lime build/test [platform] (--debug)`
